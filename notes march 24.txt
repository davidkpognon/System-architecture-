When the operating system wants to allocate memory to a process, it scours memory for any unused pages it can discover. If no free pages are available, the memory management system must chose pages that are still in use by other processes and appear to be the least likely to be needed in the near future. The selection of those pages necessitates the use of CPU cycles. A page scan is the procedure for locating such pages. When a page scan is necessary, the CPU usage rises.
A process's physical memory consumption is referred to as a working set. Under typical conditions, the more frequently a process's pages are accessed, the closer the working set is to the process's committed memory consumption. With this in mind, one may believe that if you add up all of the processes' working sets, you'll get close to the total amount of physical RAM used on the system.
As a general rule, it's never a bad idea to install as much RAM as your motherboard can handle.Â Fill your computer box with as much RAM as your motherboard will allow, as long as it's the right type.
